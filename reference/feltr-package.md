# feltr: Access the Felt API

Upload, download, and edit internet maps with the Felt API
(<https://developers.felt.com/rest-api/getting-started>). Allows users
to create new maps, edit existing maps, and extract data. Provides tools
for working with layers, which represent geographic data, and elements,
which are interactive annotations. Spatial data accessed from the API is
transformed to work with 'sf'.
